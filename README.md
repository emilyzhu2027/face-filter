## Personal Project #1: Face Filter
### Description:
##### This code uses the OpenCV library to detect faces in a livestreamed video and applies a "filter" over faces that are in frame. The filter image moves with any faces that are detected and will be displayed on the video livestream.
##### Unfortunately, my code is currently only able to handle filter images that are rectangular. Moving forward, I hope to be able to use more complex images that are more realistic.
### Usage:
##### 1) Download the .py file and the sample_img.jpeg
##### 2) Install OpenCV (Linux: > pip3 install cv2)
##### 3) Run the .py file (Linux: > python3 face_filter.py)
##### Note: you can replace sample_img.jpeg with any other rectangular image you want in line 15
### Credits:
##### I used the webpages below to gain a greater knowledge of OpenCV, to better understand the OpenCV functions I used, and to brainstorm future expansions of this project.
